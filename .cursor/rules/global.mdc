Do not overcomplicate things, by creating a lot of new files, instead reuse existing files as much as possible and only create new files only if it's really required, like moving reusable code which is used in two or more files.
If you made some changes in the code, then always verify that cargo build is not throwing any warnings or errors, else fix them all.
ALWAYS use timeout on any of your commands! For example timeout 10 ./scripts/build_incremental.sh or timeout 30 ./scripts/build_clean.sh
Rebuild build image if made some changes in Dockerfile.build or in build_builder_image.sh
./scripts/app.sh should be used to go through full process i.e. to build extension (incremental by default), install extension and rebuild indices, use it if you need to check or test the full flow.
Do not build cargo outside of the docker container, we are only building rust cargo inside docker container, there is a specific file for that, build_incremental.sh and build_clean.sh, so use these and modify them if something should be changed in the building process.
